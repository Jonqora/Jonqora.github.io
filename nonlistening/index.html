          <h3>Is it possible to listen, but still disagree?</h3>
          <p>Opinions vary! Listening means different things to different people. When someone says listening has not occurred, there are several possible interaction types. This theory describes listening as a process capturing the extent of message transmission and acceptance between a sender and receiver.</p>
          <img src="images/sender-message-receiver.png" class="smallimage"/>
          <p>Listening interactions can include various stages. All are not always necessary, but an <strong>unambiguous listening interaction</strong> includes every stage. A sender is able to <span class="listeningtype">express</span> a message, with mutual <span class="listeningtype">access</span> to the receiver; the listener is willingly <span class="listeningtype">present</span> in this interaction, <span class="listeningtype">considers</span> the message content, and perhaps <span class="listeningtype">complies</span> by changing their attitude, beliefs, or behaviour.</p>
          <img src="images/listening-model.png" class="wideimage" />
          <p>Each has a non-listening counterpart: these interactions hinder the extent of message expression, transmission, or acceptance. A sixth non-listening type, <span class="nonlisteningtype">disruption</span>, aims to stop others from listening. Disruptive non-listeners can prompt others who are present to <span class="nonlisteningtype">withdraw</span>; persuade those who might consider a message to <span class="nonlisteningtype">dismiss</span> it; and lead others to <span class="nonlisteningtype">refuse</span> requests rather than comply.</p>

          <p>In <span class="nonlisteningtype">blocking</span>, a message is halted at its source. A would-be message sender feels disempowered and held back from <span class="listeningtype">expression</span>. The sender in this situation feels a lack of control or autonomy. The source of the blocking force can range from external (threats, etc.) to a more internal holding back in response to circumstances with negative outcomes for expression. An external blocking force may not be overtly visible to observers.</p>

          <p>In <span class="nonlisteningtype">isolation</span>, disconnectivity in a communication network prevents mutual <span class="listeningtype">access</span> for sender-receiver communication. The sender expresses a message, but the message fails to reach a certain would-be receiver. No engagement is possible as a result. Perceptions of these situations vary on who ought to have message access, and who is responsible to facilitate that access. </p>

          <p>In <span class="nonlisteningtype">withdrawal</span>, a message receiver hears a message, but does not maintain <span class="listeningtype">presence</span>. The message is expressed with mutual access, but the receiver chooses to assert limited power over self and withdraw. By doing this, they disengage from a listening role and terminate the interaction. Withdrawal is perceived as a non-listening, low-effort option in communication settings.</p>

          <p>In <span class="nonlisteningtype">dismissal</span>, a message receiver is present to receive a message. They give a response but enagage only superficially; they do not give true <span class="listeningtype">consideration</span> to message content, and they respond by disregarding or rejecting the message. By doing this the receiver asserts power over the message sender, who feels unheard. Receivers who dismiss a message feel that their response is reasonable or justified; dismissed senders see it as disrespectful.</p>

          <img src="images/refusal.png" class="smallimage" />
          <p>In <span class="nonlisteningtype">refusal</span>, a message receiver hears a message and engages more fully, giving consideration to message content and a good-faith response. The message sender may have expectations for change, however, and the receiver (in a position of power to comply or not) stops short of actual <span class="listeningtype">compliance</span> with one or more expectations. The message receiver perceives their own response as thoughtful consideration.</p>

          <img src="images/disruption.png" class="smallimage" />
          <p>Disruption falls outside the normal (non)listening continuum. In <span class="nonlisteningtype">disruption</span>, communication between a sender and receiver is disrupted by a third party. Disruption aims to increase <span class="nonlisteningtype">withdrawal</span>, <span class="nonlisteningtype">dismissal</span>, and <span class="nonlisteningtype">refusal</span> by message receivers. The disruptive non-listener feels disempowered, and their actions are a power play: a desperate effort to wrest more control in a situation where they feel little or none. Disruption is unambiguously seen as rude or aggressive; perceptions vary on whether it is justified by the circumstances.</p>
